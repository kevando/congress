# **Senators on Twitter**

Most US Senators like to use Twitter, but do the Senators like each other on Twitter? 

Let's find out by using the [Twitter API].

We are currently in the [116th meeting of Congress] which is comprised of 2 Senators from 50 states.  `2 x 50 = 100 Senators!` Okay that math is easy if you passed grade school. HÃ¥ow many possible connections exist between all Senators? (*Answer is at the end*) 

This data is from March 24, 2017. Shoot me a message on Twitter if you'd like to know how I made this or if you have any ideas on how to spice this baby up.
