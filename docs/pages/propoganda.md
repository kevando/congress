# Freedom Torch

In **1927** it was considered taboo for women to smoke cigarettes.

This caused a problem for tabaco companies because they wanted to sell cigarettes to women. *Half the population!* So they hatched a plan. They staged some models at the 1929 [Easter Sunday Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_parade) to light up cigarettes in "defiance." Knowning full well the newspaper photographers would be there to capture it, the women clamed they were smoking "torches of freedom." They created the idea that if a women smokes, she is powerful and independent. It worked because they aligned with the women's sufferage movement.

This proved that irrelevant objects could become powerful emotional symbols for how you want to be seen.

This was some of the earliest propoganda.
