Life as we know is ending. 

Masks are not there to protect us from germs, it's a way to shock the system. Wake everyone up so they're alert.

<!-- “Everything great is just as difficult to realize, as it is rare to find.”
You may of course ask, whether we really need to refer to ‘saints.’ Wouldn’t it suffice just to refer to ‘decent people?’ It is true they form a minority. More than that, they always will remain a minority.
And yet, I see therein the very challenge to join the minority.
For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.
So let us be alert. Alert in a two fold sense.
Since Auschwitz, we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima, we know what is at stake. -->
