Life as we know it is ending.

For the past 50 years, America's dominated position went unchecked. Our military and economic superiority gave us influence everywhere. American citizens could travel where ever they wanted. Nations sold their oil in our currency. People loved our movies. Football, that never caught on. 

But that all changes with the rise of China and it's time for America to buckle up.

Luckily, it seems we've been given seat belts.

### Education

The Corona virus forced many schools to close and go online. From kindergarten to college, many students now sit in front of a computer instead of a teacher. We can't hide the fact that our schools suck any longer. It's so bad the only we either give up on America, or we take risks and fix it.

### Government

The dirtbags we elected to run things are not helping. Even Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen agrees.
