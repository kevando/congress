description: New York City, 1929. Thirty debutantes marched down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade. They light up cigarettes to combat prejudice against women smokers. The press calls them 'torches of freedom' and spreads the message. This is propoganda.

Most people do not understand propaganda. The reason for that is mostly because the dictionary is wrong. **Google** says *information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.* According to **Webster**,  *2 : the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person. 3 : ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause also : a public action having such an effect.*

The truth is that propaganda is not effective if it's not true. Edward Bernays wrote the book on Propaganda.

> If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it.

> "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country."




### **Influencing the influencer**


Social media can be used to spread propaganda. The most powerful propaganda tool ever created. It's analagous to planes amplifying the speed and distance we can travel compared to before. And now that we have "influencers" all over the place, we can once again look to the wisdom of Edward Bernays.


> If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway.

 One's ability to successfully manipulate an influence gives them great power. Just look at the insanity surrounding Billy Ellish. The only logical conclusion one could make for her fast rise in popularity is the people around her understand propaganda very well.

### **Trolling**

Anticipating the way a group will react is the heart of propaganda. Trolls on the internet go 1 step beyond and anticipate the reaction to the reaction. South Park explains this very well with something they call Trevor's Axiom.
