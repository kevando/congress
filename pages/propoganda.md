> "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. `Propaganda` will never die out."

## **New York City**

There is 1929 and American Tobacco Company has a problem. women won't smoke because the habit was seen as corrupt and inappropriate for women. The story of how [Edward Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) solved their problem is something every American should know. 

Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality.

He also told the press to expect that women suffragists would light up “torches of freedom” during the parade to show they were equal to men.

Bernays' claim that he could now encourage women to smoke by linking cigarettes to notions of freedom and rebellion turned out to be correct.c

Marches also took place in Boston, Detroit, and San Francisco, and newspapers across the country published stories on it. Smoking became a torch of liberty and freedom for women. A symbol of independence.

Cigarettes were promoted as a substitute for the ballot.

This was due not only to the dramatic changes in the social and economic status of women over this period but also to the way in which the tobacco industry capitalised on the changing social attitudes towards women by promoting smoking as a symbol of emancipation, a “torch of freedom.

This is **propoganda.** Through the use of networking and media, Bernays manipulated the opinion and values of women. By turning a simple cigarette into something symbolic, he demonstrated that symbols are way more powerful than we previously thought.
