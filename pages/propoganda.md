Most people do not understand propaganda. The reason for that is mostly because the dictionary is wrong. **Google** says *information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.* According to **Webster**,  *2 : the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person. 3 : ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause also : a public action having such an effect.*

The truth is that propaganda is not effective if it's not true. Edward Bernays wrote the book on Propaganda.

> If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it.

> "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country."




### **Influencing the influencer**


Social media can be used to spread propaganda. The most powerful propaganda tool ever created. It's analagous to planes amplifying the speed and distance we can travel compared to before. And now that we have "influencers" all over the place, we can once again look to the wisdom of Edward Bernays.


> If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway.

 One's ability to successfully manipulate an influence gives them great power. Just look at the insanity surrounding Billy Ellish. The only logical conclusion one could make for her fast rise in popularity is the people around her understand propaganda very well.

### **Trolling**

Anticipating the way a group will react is the heart of propaganda. Trolls on the internet go 1 step beyond and anticipate the reaction to the reaction. South Park explains this very well with something they call Trevor's Axiom.

<!-- ## **New York City** -->

<!-- The year is **1929.** American `Tobacco` Company has a problem. women won't smoke because the habit was seen as corrupt and inappropriate for women. The story of how [Edward Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) solved their problem is something every American should know.  -->

<!-- "Got Milk" campaign is a great benign example. -->

<!-- 

Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality.

### This could be big news

He also told the press to expect that women suffragists would light up “torches of freedom” during the parade to show they were equal to men.

<!-- This is **propoganda.** Through the use of networking and media, Bernays manipulated the opinion and values of women. By turning a simple cigarette into something symbolic, he demonstrated that symbols are way more powerful than we previously thought. -->

- quote: The American motion picture is the greatest unconscious carrier of propaganda in the world today. It is a great distributor for ideas and opinions. The motion picture can standardize the ideas and habits of a nation. Because pictures are made to meet market demands, they reflect, emphasize and even exaggerate broad popular tendencies, rather than stimulate new ideas and opinions. The motion picture avails itself only of ideas and facts which are in vogue. As the newspaper seeks to purvey news, it seeks to purvey entertainment.”
