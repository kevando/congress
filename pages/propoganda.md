Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. `Propaganda` will never die out." -->

<!-- ## **New York City** -->

<!-- The year is **1929.** American `Tobacco` Company has a problem. women won't smoke because the habit was seen as corrupt and inappropriate for women. The story of how [Edward Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) solved their problem is something every American should know.  -->

Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality.

### This could be big news

He also told the press to expect that women suffragists would light up “torches of freedom” during the parade to show they were equal to men.

This is **propoganda.** Through the use of networking and media, Bernays manipulated the opinion and values of women. By turning a simple cigarette into something symbolic, he demonstrated that symbols are way more powerful than we previously thought.
