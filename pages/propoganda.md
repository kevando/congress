### What is propaganda?

Propaganda is a mechanism for influencing. 

It's not a fun truth, but you are influenced in ways that you cannot see. 

True power comes from one's ability to control influence.

# Dangers

Social media amplifies the distance and effectiveness of propaganda. By a lot. It's analagous to planes amplifying the speed and distance we can travel compared to before. 

`Influencing the influencer`

<!-- ## **New York City** -->

<!-- The year is **1929.** American `Tobacco` Company has a problem. women won't smoke because the habit was seen as corrupt and inappropriate for women. The story of how [Edward Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) solved their problem is something every American should know.  -->


## Modern Examples

"Got Milk" campaign is a benign example.

Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality.

### This could be big news

He also told the press to expect that women suffragists would light up ‚Äútorches of freedom‚Äù during the parade to show they were equal to men.

This is **propoganda.** Through the use of networking and media, Bernays manipulated the opinion and values of women. By turning a simple cigarette into something symbolic, he demonstrated that symbols are way more powerful than we previously thought.

- quote: The American motion picture is the greatest unconscious carrier of propaganda in the world today. It is a great distributor for ideas and opinions. The motion picture can standardize the ideas and habits of a nation. Because pictures are made to meet market demands, they reflect, emphasize and even exaggerate broad popular tendencies, rather than stimulate new ideas and opinions. The motion picture avails itself only of ideas and facts which are in vogue. As the newspaper seeks to purvey news, it seeks to purvey entertainment.‚Äù
