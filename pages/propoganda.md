### The year is **1929.**

American Tobacco Company has a problem. Only men smoke. Women that smoked were considered whores.

This is the story of how Edward Bernays solved their problem.

### **New York City**

Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality.

He also told the press to expect that women suffragists would light up ‚Äútorches of freedom‚Äù during the parade to show they were equal to men.

Bernays' claim that he could now encourage women to smoke by linking cigarettes to notions of freedom and rebellion turned out to be correct.

Marches also took place in Boston, Detroit, and San Francisco, and newspapers across the country published stories on it. Smoking became a torch of liberty and freedom for women. A symbol of independence.

### _Cigarettes were promoted as a substitute for the ballot._

This was due not only to the dramatic changes in the social and economic status of women over this period but also to the way in which the tobacco industry capitalised on the changing social attitudes towards women by promoting smoking as a symbol of emancipation, a ‚Äútorch of freedom.

This is **propoganda.** Through the use of networking and media, Bernays manipulated the opinion and values of women. By turning a simple cigarette into something symbolic, he demonstrated that symbols are way more powerful than we previously thought.

### That was almost **100 years ago.**
