For now, a quote from [Viktor Frankl](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/0671023373):

> Everything great is just as difficult to realize, as it is rare to find. 
>
> You may of course ask, whether we really need to refer to ‘saints.’ Wouldn’t it suffice just to refer to ‘decent people?’ It is true they form a minority. More than that, they always will remain a minority.
>
> And yet, I see therein the very challenge to join the minority.
>
> For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.
>
> So let us be alert. Alert in a two fold sense.
>
> **Since Auschwitz, we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima, we know what is at stake.**
