Today it's possible to gather a following of millions on social media. If your ability to sway the group is very high, you called an "influencer." For example, Kim Kardasian is one of the biggest.
  
> If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. 



<!-- - quote: If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it. -->


<!-- - quote: The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. -->

<!-- 
- quote: The American motion picture is the greatest unconscious carrier of propaganda in the world today. It is a great distributor for ideas and opinions. The motion picture can standardize the ideas and habits of a nation. Because pictures are made to meet market demands, they reflect, emphasize and even exaggerate broad popular tendencies, rather than stimulate new ideas and opinions. The motion picture avails itself only of ideas and facts which are in vogue. As the newspaper seeks to purvey news, it seeks to purvey entertainment.”

- quote: Propaganda will never die out. Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos.
  person: Edward Bernays

- quote: We are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.

<!-- Bernays telegrammed thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue to participate in the demonstration, encouraging them to combat the prejudice against women smokers. He then encouraged women to march down Fifth Avenue during the Easter parade in New York City and protest against gender inequality. -->
