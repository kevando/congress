title: Freedom Torch
description: "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. `Propaganda` will never die out."
