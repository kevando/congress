Most US Senators probably *like* each other. But do they *like each other on Twitter?* 

Let's find out.

Today is **March 24, 2017** That means we're in the [116th meeting of congress]. We got **50 states.** That means 100 Twitter handles for 100 Senators. I gathered these and put them in a spreadsheet. Then I used the [Twitter API] to map all possible connections. 

# 4,950 Connections

I define a connection as a non unique relationship between 2 individual Senators. This means each Senator has 99 connections, but a self connection ain't one. 

<!-- For example:

- Cory Booker follows Tom Cotton (Orange)
- Tom Cotton is followed by Cory Booker (Blue)
- Cory Booker and Al Franken are friends (Purple)
- Al Franken and Cory Booker are friends (Purple) -->
