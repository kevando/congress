The American economy is out of balance.

This time it's not just our current situtation, it's the whole system. How we react to this will decide the fate of America. We need high quality discourse happening in public.

> Capitalism and Communism which briefly resembled victor and vanquished, increasingly look more like Thelma and Louise; a tragic couple sent over the edge by forces beyond their control. What comes next is anyoneâ€™s guess and the world hangs in the balance. 

**-- Eric Weinstein**

I like this quote because the image of a car driving off a cliff is what comes to mind when I see the graph below of how much money we print.

We just printed $2,000,000,000 and we're still in trouble. This graphs shows the Fed's balance sheet. In otherwords: how much money the US prints. It nearly doubled in 2020.

It seems like something big is coming to the dollar. Lets review the most recent big changes.

- **1945** -- Gold backed Dollar becomes the world reserve currency
- **1971** -- Nixon announces end to gold standard
- **2020** -- _What can we expect now?_

### Wealth

Wealth is not money. Wealth is your ability to generate money. Jeff Bezos does not have \$100 billion dollars. People who claim he can solve world hunger are misinformed.
