Our capitalism is out of balance. The CCP will challenge capitalism in the near future in a variety of ways. It's already happening. How the US reacts will decide the next decade. Or as Eric Weinstein puts it:

> *Capitalism and Communism which briefly resembled victor and vanquished, increasingly look more like Thelma and Louise; a tragic couple sent over the edge by forces beyond their control. What comes next is anyoneâ€™s guess and the world hangs in the balance.*

# Wealth

## Is money the same thing as wealth?
No. This is a common misconception. Wealth is the ability to generate money. Jeff Bezos does not have $100 billion dollars. Claims that he can solve pworld hunger are false.
