U.S. capitalism is out of balance and the CCP will try to topple us. We need a high quality conversation that occurs in the public forum. How the US reacts will decide the next decade. Buckle up.

## Socialism

Capitalism and Communism which briefly resembled victor and vanquished, increasingly look more like Thelma and Louise; a tragic couple sent over the edge by forces beyond their control. What comes next is anyoneâ€™s guess and the world hangs in the balance.  **-- Eric Weinstein**

## Money

There is a big move coming. An important question to ask: "What happens if the dollar loses its place as the world reserve currency?"

Lets review the most recent big changes

- **1945** -- US Dollar becomes the world reserve currency backed by gold.
- **1971** -- Nixon announces end to gold standard
- **2020** -- *What can we expect now?*

This graphs shows the Fed's balance sheet. In otherwords: how much money the US prints. It nearly doubled in 2020.

## Wealth

Wealth is not money. Wealth is your ability to generate money. Jeff Bezos does not have $100 billion dollars. Claims that he can solve world hunger are false. The U.S. will experience a huge **wealth transfer** of the next two decades.
