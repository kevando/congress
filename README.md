![Lady Liberty]

This repo contains two distinctly different applications. On the `netlify` branch is a ReactJs website that is a work in progress. It communicates with an api who's codebase can be found on the `express-api` branch. **My goal** is to present civic information in a format that's both interesting and funny. Acheiving that goal will require experimenting and this repo is that experiment.

> It's free to give a shit

The first experiment is to track Congress on Twitter. The [Twitter API] provides data such as total followers and total tweets. If we pull stats on all 535 members of Congress, something interesting will emerge. At least that's the first hypothesis.

**The first thing that jumps out** is the massive popularity of [Bernie Sanders] and [Elizabeth Warren]. They have more followers than the next 14 Senators combined. And what makes the size of Bernie's audience (`10.3 million`) really stand out is that he represents the 2nd smallest (population-wise) state in the country. Vermont has only `493k` eligible voters. That makes his reach on Twitter nearly `21x` that of his home state. Talk about a megaphone! `10,300,000 / 493,000 = 20.9`

**If you want to contribute**, [Open an Issue] and introduce yourself. There's lots more data to gather. Both `us-states.tsv` and `us-congress.tsv` were created in Google Sheets and exported as tab-seperated values.
