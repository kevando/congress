1929 women smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walk in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York.

He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world. 

The targeting of women in tobacco advertising led to higher rates of smoking among women. In 1923 women only purchased `5%` of cigarettes sold, in 1929 that percentage increased to `12%`, in 1935 to `18.1%`, peaking in 1965 at `33.3%`, and remaining at this level until 1977.
