> *"If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it. The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. Propaganda will never die out. Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos."*
